    <h3>LSAMP Research Fellow – Cochlear Implant Path Planning</h3>
    <p>As a current LSAMP Research Fellow, I have introduced a machine learning component to an ongoing cochlear implant simulation project. I use physical electrode data to train a model that enhances the precision of path planning algorithms for cochlear insertion.</p>
    <p>Future work focuses on enhancing device compatibility and further minimizing insertion trauma through anatomical adaptability and machine learning integration.</p>

    <h3>CVRC Undergraduate Research Assistant – Cochlear Implant Modeling</h3>
    <p>Before joining LSAMP, I contributed to the same cochlear implant project as a research assistant in the CVRC lab. My focus was on foundational modeling, including MRI segmentation, anatomical 3D modeling, and simulation setup.</p>
    <p>I developed anatomical models using ITK-SNAP, refined them in Blender and SolidWorks, and used MATLAB for visualization. I also built a Python script using Trimesh, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process STL files and explore early path planning strategies.</p>
