    <h3>LSAMP Research Fellow – Cochlear Implant Path Planning</h3>
    <p>As an LSAMP Research Fellow, I enhanced my existing cochlear implant simulation project by integrating machine learning techniques. I used physical electrode data to train a model capable of optimizing insertion path trajectories with greater anatomical precision.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Project Goal:</strong> To develop a patient-specific, minimally traumatic cochlear implant insertion pipeline using machine learning and anatomical modeling.</p>
    
    <p>My current focus is on improving device compatibility and minimizing insertion trauma through adaptive, data-driven surgical planning.</p>
    
    <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem;">
      <li>Software: ITK-SNAP, 3D Slicer, Blender, SolidWorks</li>
      <li>Programming: Python (Trimesh, NumPy, Matplotlib), MATLAB</li>
      <li>Data: MRI segmentation, STL modeling, electrode geometry extraction</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> I plan to validate the simulation results with physical insertion trials and explore device-specific adaptation strategies to enhance compatibility across cochlear implant systems.</p>

    <h3>CVRC Undergraduate Research Assistant – Cochlear Implant Modeling</h3>
    <p>Before joining LSAMP, I joined the hearing loss project as a research assistant in the CVRC lab. My focus was on foundational modeling of the inner ear, including MRI segmentation, anatomical 3D modeling, and simulation setup for cochlear implantation.</p>
    
    <p>I developed anatomical models using ITK-SNAP, refined them in Blender and SolidWorks, and used MATLAB for visualization. I also built a Python script using Trimesh, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process STL files and explore early path planning strategies.</p>
